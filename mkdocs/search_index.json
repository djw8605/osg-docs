You might ask \"why do I care? Can\u2019t you just give them to me?\" We can, but you have a few things to consider:\n\n\n\n\nWhat set of CA certificates do you want? How much control do you want over the set of CA certificates? (Some sites might not want to install specific CAs for policy or security reasons.)\n\n\nHow do you want to update them?\n\n\nDo you want to centrally manage the CA certificates or install them on each computer at your site?\n\n\n\n\nYou have four options for installing CA certificates:\n\n\n\n\nInstall an RPM for a specific set of CA certificates.\n\n\nInstall \nosg-update-certs\n, a program that lets you install/update a predefined set of CA certificates, then adjust the set by adding or deleting specific CAs.\n\n\nInstall an RPM that installs \nno\n CAs. This is useful when you want your RPM installations to succeed (because our RPMs require CA certificates, and this RPM satisfies that dependency) but you want to manage them with your own technique.\n\n\nMake no choice, let \nyum\n decide for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally this page also provides instruction on installation of a tool (fetch-crl) to ensure your site has up-to-date certificate revocation list (CRL) from the CA.\n\n\nPrior to following the instructions on this page, you must enable our \nyum repositories\n\n\nInstall CA certificates: Options\n\n\nPlease choose one of the four options to install the CA certificates.\n\n\nOption 1: Install an RPM for a specific set of CA certificates\n\n\nIf you want to install an RPM for one of our predefined CA certificates, you have two choices to make:\n\n\nWhich set of CAs?\n\n\n\n\n(\nrecommended\n) The OSG CA certificates. This is similar to the IGTF set, but may have a small number of additions or deletions. (See \nhere\n for details)\n\n\nThe default \nIGTF\n CA certificates.\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your choice, you select one of two RPMs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet of CAs\n\n\nFormat\n --\n\n\nRPM name\n\n\nInstallation command (as root)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG\n\n\nOpenSSL-both\n\n\nosg-ca-certs\n\n\nyum install osg-ca-certs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIGTF\n\n\nOpenSSL-both\n\n\nigtf-ca-certs\n\n\nyum install igtf-ca-certs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I keep CAs updated?\n\n\nPlease follow the \nupdate instructions\n to make sure that the CAs are kept updated.\n\n\nOption 2: Install osg-update-certs\n\n\nInstall this with:\n\n\n[root@client ~]$ yum install osg-ca-scripts\n\n\n\n\nYou have the same choices for CA certificates as above. In order to choose, you will run \nosg-ca-manage\n, which will install the CA certificates. Then (if desired) you need to enable periodic updating of the CA certificates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet of CAs\n\n\nFormat\n\n\nCA certs name\n\n\nInstallation command (as root)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG\n\n\nOpenSSL-both\n\n\nosg\n\n\n/usr/sbin/osg-ca-manage setupCA --location root --url osg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIGTF\n\n\nOpenSSL-both\n\n\nigtf\n\n\n/usr/sbin/osg-ca-manage setupCA --location root --url igtf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example:\n\n\n[root@client ~]$ /usr/sbin/osg-ca-manage setupCA --location root --url osg \nSetting up CA Certificates for OSG installation\nCA Certificates will be installed into /etc/grid-security/certificates\nosg-update-certs\n  Log file: /var/log/osg-update-certs.log\n  Updates from: http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ca-certs-version-new\n\nWill update CA certificates from version unknown to version 1.21NEW.\nUpdate successful.\n\nSetup completed successfully.\n\n\n\n\nInitially the CA certificates will not be updated.

You must install them in \n/etc/grid-security/certificates\n, or make a symlink from that location to the directory that contains the CA certificates.\n\n\n\n\nOption 4: Make no choice, let yum decide for you\n\n\nIf you use \nyum\n to install software that requires CA certificates but you haven\u2019t made one of these choices, yum will choose a default. Right now, it is Option #1 from above (\nInstall an RPM for a specific set of CA certificates\n), and the osg-ca-certs RPM is chosen.\n\n\nInstall other CAs\n\n\nIn addition to the above CAs, you can install other CAs via RPM. These only work with the RPMs that provide CAs (that is, \nosg-ca-certs\n and the like, but not \nosg-ca-scripts\n.) They are in addition to the above RPMs, so do not only install these extra CAs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet of CAs\n\n\nFormat\n\n\nRPM name\n\n\nInstallation command (as root)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncilogon-basic \n cilogon-openid\n\n\nOpenSSL-both\n\n\ncilogon-ca-certs\n\n\nyum install cilogon-ca-certs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging Certificate Revocation Lists\n\n\nIn addition to CA certificates, you normally need to have updated Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) which are are lists of certificates that have been revoked for any reason. Software in the OSG Software Stack use these to ensure that you are talking to valid clients or servers. We use a tool named \nfetch-crl\n that periodically updates the CRLs. Fetch CRL is a utility that updates Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). These are lists of certificates that were granted by the CA, but have since been revoked. It is good practice to regularly update the CRL list for each CA to ensure that you do not authenticate any certificate that has been revoked.\n\n\nfetch-crl\n is installed as two different system services. The fetch-crl-boot service runs only\nat boot time. The \nfetch-crl-cron\n service runs \nfetch-crl\n every 6 hours (with a random sleep\ntime included) by default. Both services are disabled by default. At the very minimum, the\n\nfetch-crl-cron\n service needs to be enabled otherwise services will begin to fail as the\nexisting CRLs expire.\n\n\nInstall \nfetch-crl\n\n\nNormally \nfetch-crl\n is installed when you install the rest of the software and you do not need\nto specifically install it. If you do wish to install it, you can install it as:\n\n\n# For RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and SL5 \n\n[root@client ~]$ yum install fetch-crl3\n\n# For RHEL 6 or 7, CentOS 6 or 7, and SL6 or SL7 \n\n[root@client ~]$ yum install fetch-crl\n\n\n\n\nEnable and Start \nfetch-crl\n\n\nTo enable fetch-crl (fetch Certificate Revocation Lists) services by default on the node:\n\n\n# For RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and SL5 \n\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl3-boot on\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl3-cron on\n\n# For RHEL 6 or 7, CentOS 6 or 7, and SL6 or SL7 \n \n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-boot on\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-cron on\n\n\n\n\nTo start fetch-crl:\n\n\n# For RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and SL5 \n\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/service fetch-crl3-boot start\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/service fetch-crl3-cron start\n\n# For RHEL 6 or 7, CentOS 6 or 7, and SL6 or SL7 \n \n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/service fetch-crl-boot start\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/service fetch-crl-cron start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhile it is necessary to start \nfetch-crl-cron\n in order to have it active, \nfetch-crl-boot\n is started automatically at boot time if enabled. The start command will run \nfetch-crl-boot\n at the moment when it is invoked and it may take some time to complete.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure \nfetch-crl\n\n\nTo modify the times that fetch-crl-cron runs, edit \n/etc/cron.d/fetch-crl\n (or \n/etc/cron.d/fetch-crl3\n depending on the version you have).\n\n\nBy default, \nfetch-crl\n connects directly to the remote CA; this is\ninefficient and potentially harmful if done simultaneously by many nodes\n(e.g. all the worker nodes of a big cluster). We recommend you provide a\nHTTP proxy (such as \nsquid\n) the worker nodes can utilize; OSG provides\n\npackaging of squid\n.\n\n\nTo configure fetch-crl to use an HTTP proxy server:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using \nfetch-crl\n version 2 (the \nfetch-crl\n package on RHEL5 only), then create the file \n/etc/sysconfig/fetch-crl\n and add the following line:\n\n\nexport http_proxy=\nhttp://your.squid.fqdn:port\n\n\nAdjust the URL appropriately for your proxy server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using \nfetch-crl\n version 3 on RHEL5 via the \nfetch-crl3\n package\n    or on RHEL6/RHEL7 via the \nfetch-crl\n package, then create or edit the\n    file \n/etc/fetch-crl3.conf\n (RHEL5) or \n/etc/fetch-crl.conf\n\n    (RHEL6/RHEL7) and add the following line:\n\n\nhttp_proxy=\nhttp://your.squid.fqdn:port\n\n\nAgain, adjust the URL appropriately for your proxy server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the \nnosymlinks\n option in the configuration files refers\nto ignoring links within the certificates directory (e.g. two different\nnames for the same file). It is perfectly fine if the path of the CA\ncertificates directory itself (\ninfodir\n) is a link to a directory.\n\n\nAny modifications to the configuration file will be preserved during an RPM update.\n\n\nCurrent versions of \nfetch-crl\n and \nfetch-crl3\n produce more output.\nIt is possible to send the output to syslog instead of the default email system. To do so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the configuration file to enable syslog:\n\n\nlogmode = syslog\n  syslogfacility = daemon\\\n/pre\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the file \n/var/log/daemon\n exists, e.g. touching the file\n\n\n\n\nChange \n/etc/logrotate.d\n files to rotate it\n\n\n\n\nStart/Stop fetch-crl: A quick guide\n\n\nYou need to fetch the latest CA Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and you should enable the fetch-crl service to keep the CRLs up to date:\n\n\n# For RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and SL5 \n\n[root@client ~]$ /usr/sbin/fetch-crl3 # This fetches the CRLs\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/service fetch-crl3-boot start\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/service fetch-crl3-cron start\n\n# For RHEL 6 or 7, CentOS 6 or 7, and SL6 or SL7\n\n[root@client ~]$ /usr/sbin/fetch-crl # This fetches the CRLs\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/service fetch-crl-boot start\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/service fetch-crl-cron start\n\n\n\n\nTo enable the \nfetch-crl\n service to keep the CRLs up to date after reboots:\n\n\n# For RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and SL5 \n\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl3-boot on\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl3-cron on\n\n# For RHEL 6 or 7, CentOS 6 or 7, and SL6 or SL7 \n\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-boot on\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-cron on\n\n\n\n\nTo stop \nfetch-crl\n:\n\n\n# For RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and SL5 \n\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/service fetch-crl3-boot stop\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/service fetch-crl3-cron stop\n\n# For RHEL 6 or 7, CentOS 6 or 7, and SL6 or SL7 \n\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/service fetch-crl-boot stop\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/service fetch-crl-cron stop\n\n\n\n\nTo disable the fetch-crl service:\n\n\n# For RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and SL5 \n\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl3-boot off\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl3-cron off\n\n# For RHEL 6 or 7, CentOS 6 or 7, and SL6 or SL7 \n\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-boot off\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-cron off\n\n\n\n\nUpdating CAs/CRLs\n\n\nWhy maintain up-to-date Trusted CA /CRL information\n\n\nThe Trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates, and their associated Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), are used for every transaction on a resource that establishes an authenticated network connection based on end user\u2019s certificate. In order for the authentication to succeed, the user\u2019s certificate must have been issued by one of the CAs in the Trusted CA directory, and the user\u2019s certificate must not be listed in the CRL for that CA. CRLs can be thought of as a black list of certificates. CAs are the trust authorities, similar to DMV that issues you the driving license. (Another way of thinking CRLs is the do-not-fly lists at the airports. if your certificate shows up in CRLs, you are not allowed access.) This is handled at the certificate validation stage even before the authorization check (which will provide the mapping of an authenticated user to a local account UID/GID). So you do not need to do worry about it; the grid software will do this for you. However, you should make sure that your site has the most up-to-date list of Trusted CAs. There are multiple trust authorities in OSG (think of it as a different DMV for each state). If you do not have an up-to-date list of CAs it is possible that some of your users transactions at your site will start to fail. A current CRL list for each CA is also necessary, since without one transactions for users of that CA will fail.\n\n\nHow to ensure you are get up-to-date CA/CRL information\n\n\n\n\nIf you installed CAs using rpm packages (\nosg-ca-certs\n,\nigtf-ca-certs\n) (Options 1, 4), you will need to install the software described in \nthe CA update document\n, and enable \nosg-ca-certs-updater\n service to keep the CAs automatically updated. If you do not install the updater, you will have to regularly run yum update to keep the CAs updated.\n\n\nIf you use Option 2 (i.e. \nosg-update-certs\n) then make sure that you have the corresponding service enabled.\n\n\n\n\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/service osg-update-certs-cron  status\n   Periodic osg-update-certs is enabled.\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that fetch-crl cron is enabled\\\n\n\n\n\n[root@client ~]$ /sbin/service fetch-crl-cron  status\n  Periodic fetch-crl is enabled.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nUseful configuration and log files\n\n\nConfiguration files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll CA Packages\n\n\nCA File Location\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/certificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll CA Packages\n\n\nIndex files\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/certificates/INDEX.html\n or \n/etc/grid-security/certificates/INDEX.txt\n\n\nLatest version also available at \nhttp://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll CA Packages\n\n\nChange Log\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/certificates/CHANGES\n\n\nLatest version also available at \nhttp://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/CHANGES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-certs or igtf-ca-certs\n\n\ncontain only CA files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-scripts\n\n\nConfiguration File for osg-update-certs\n\n\n/etc/osg/osg-update-certs.conf\n\n\nThis file may be edited by hand, though it is recommended to use osg-ca-manage to set configuration parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfetch-crl-2.x\n\n\nConfiguration file\n\n\n/etc/fetch-crl.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfetch-crl-3.x\n\n\nConfiguration file\n\n\n/etc/fetch-crl3.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe index and change log files contain a summary of all the CA distributed and their version.\n\n\nLogs files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-scripts\n\n\nLog file of osg-update-certs\n\n\n/var/log/osg-update-certs.log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-scripts\n\n\nStdout of osg-update-certs\n\n\n/var/log/osg-ca-certs-status.system.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-scripts\n\n\nStdout of osg-ca-manage\n\n\n/var/log/osg-ca-manage.system.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-scripts\n\n\nStdout of initial CA setup\n\n\n/var/log/osg-setup-ca-certificates.system.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTests\n\n\nTo test the host certificate of a server \nopenssl s_client\n can be used.

            "text": "This document provides you with details of various options to install the Certificate Authority (CA) certificates and have up-to-date certificate revocation list (CRL).  When installing software with RPMs, you need to decide how you want to install the Certificate Authority (CA) certificates. You might ask \"why do I care? Can\u2019t you just give them to me?\" We can, but you have a few things to consider:   What set of CA certificates do you want? How much control do you want over the set of CA certificates? (Some sites might not want to install specific CAs for policy or security reasons.)  How do you want to update them?  Do you want to centrally manage the CA certificates or install them on each computer at your site?   You have four options for installing CA certificates:   Install an RPM for a specific set of CA certificates.  Install  osg-update-certs , a program that lets you install/update a predefined set of CA certificates, then adjust the set by adding or deleting specific CAs.  Install an RPM that installs  no  CAs. This is useful when you want your RPM installations to succeed (because our RPMs require CA certificates, and this RPM satisfies that dependency) but you want to manage them with your own technique.  Make no choice, let  yum  decide for you.   Additionally this page also provides instruction on installation of a tool (fetch-crl) to ensure your site has up-to-date certificate revocation list (CRL) from the CA.

By default,  fetch-crl  connects directly to the remote CA; this is\ninefficient and potentially harmful if done simultaneously by many nodes\n(e.g. all the worker nodes of a big cluster). We recommend you provide a\nHTTP proxy (such as  squid ) the worker nodes can utilize; OSG provides packaging of squid .  To configure fetch-crl to use an HTTP proxy server:    If using  fetch-crl  version 2 (the  fetch-crl  package on RHEL5 only), then create the file  /etc/sysconfig/fetch-crl  and add the following line:  export http_proxy= http://your.squid.fqdn:port  Adjust the URL appropriately for your proxy server.    If using  fetch-crl  version 3 on RHEL5 via the  fetch-crl3  package\n    or on RHEL6/RHEL7 via the  fetch-crl  package, then create or edit the\n    file  /etc/fetch-crl3.conf  (RHEL5) or  /etc/fetch-crl.conf \n    (RHEL6/RHEL7) and add the following line:  http_proxy= http://your.squid.fqdn:port  Again, adjust the URL appropriately for your proxy server.    Note that the  nosymlinks  option in the configuration files refers\nto ignoring links within the certificates directory (e.g. two different\nnames for the same file). It is perfectly fine if the path of the CA\ncertificates directory itself ( infodir ) is a link to a directory.  Any modifications to the configuration file will be preserved during an RPM update.  Current versions of  fetch-crl  and  fetch-crl3  produce more output.\nIt is possible to send the output to syslog instead of the default email system. To do so:    Change the configuration file to enable syslog:  logmode = syslog\n  syslogfacility = daemon\\ /pre\\    Make sure the file  /var/log/daemon  exists, e.g. touching the file   Change  /etc/logrotate.d  files to rotate it",

CRLs can be thought of as a black list of certificates. CAs are the trust authorities, similar to DMV that issues you the driving license. (Another way of thinking CRLs is the do-not-fly lists at the airports. if your certificate shows up in CRLs, you are not allowed access.) This is handled at the certificate validation stage even before the authorization check (which will provide the mapping of an authenticated user to a local account UID/GID). So you do not need to do worry about it; the grid software will do this for you. However, you should make sure that your site has the most up-to-date list of Trusted CAs. There are multiple trust authorities in OSG (think of it as a different DMV for each state). If you do not have an up-to-date list of CAs it is possible that some of your users transactions at your site will start to fail.

            "text": "Installing and Maintaining HTCondor-CE\n\n\nAbout This Guide\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE software is a \njob gateway\n for an OSG Compute Element\n(CE). As such, HTCondor-CE is the entry point for jobs coming from the\nOSG \u2014 it handles authorization and delegation of jobs to your local\nbatch system. In OSG today, most CEs accept \npilot jobs\n from a factory,\nwhich in turn are able to accept and run end-user jobs.\n\n\nUse this page to learn how to install, configure, run, test, and\ntroubleshoot HTCondor-CE from the OSG software repositories.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points\n(consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will\n    create the Linux user IDs \ncondor\n (UID 4716), \ntomcat\n (UID 91) and\n    \ngratia\n (UID 42401)\n\n\nService certificate:\n The HTCondor-CE service uses a host\n    certificate at \n/etc/grid-security/host*.pem\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n The pilot factories must be able to contact your\n    HTCondor-CE service on ports 9619 and 9620 (TCP)\n\n\nHost choice:\n HTCondor-CE should be installed on a host that\n    already has the ability to submit jobs into your local cluster\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per\nhost) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating\n    system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare \nthe required Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstalling HTCondor-CE\n\n\nAn HTCondor-CE installation consists of the job gateway (i.e., the\nHTCondor CE job router) and other support software (e.g., GridFTP, a\nGratia probe, authorization software). To simplify installation, OSG\nprovides convenience RPMs that install all required software with a\nsingle command.\n\n\n\n\nIf your batch system is already installed via non-RPM means and is\n   in the following list, install the appropriate 'empty' RPM. Otherwise,\n   skip to the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your batch system is\u2026\n\n\nThen run the following command\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor\n\n\nyum install empty-condor --enablerepo=osg-empty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS\n\n\nyum install empty-torque --enablerepo=osg-empty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSGE\n\n\nyum install empty-gridengine --enablerepo=osg-empty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the appropriate convenience RPM(s):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your batch system is\u2026\n\n\nThen use the following package(s)\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor\n\n\nosg-ce-condor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLSF\n\n\nosg-ce-lsf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS\n\n\nosg-ce-pbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSGE\n\n\nosg-ce-sge\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSLURM\n\n\nosg-ce-slurm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the CE software:\n\n\n\n\nyum install *PACKAGE(S)*\n\n\nTo ease the transition from GRAM\nto HTCondor-CEs, the convenience RPMs install both types of job gateway\nsoftware. By default, the HTCondor gateway is enabled and the GRAM\ngateway is disabled, which is the correct configuration for most\nHTCondor-CE-based sites (but see the gateway configuration section below\nfor more options).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nHTCondor CE version 1.6 or later\nis required to send site resource information to OSG for matching jobs\nto resources.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring HTCondor-CE\n\n\nThere are a few required configuration steps to connect HTCondor CE with\nyour batch system and authorization method. For more advanced\nconfiguration, see the section on \noptional\nconfigurations\n.\n\n\nEnabling HTCondor-CE\n\n\nIf you are installing HTCondor CE on a new host, the default\nconfiguration is correct and you can \nskip\n this step!\nHowever, if you are updating a host that used a Globus GRAM job gateway\n(aka the Globus gatekeeper), you must enable the HTCondor job gateway.\n\n\n\n\nDecide whether to disable GRAM (the preferred option) or run\n    both HTCondor and GRAM CEs\n\n\n\n\nEdit the gateway configuration file\n    \n/etc/osg/config.d/10-gateway.ini\n to reflect your choice\n    To enable HTCondor CE and disable GRAM CE:\n\n\ngram_gateway_enabled = False\nhtcondor_gateway_enabled = True\n\n\nTo enable both HTCondor and GRAM CEs:\n\n\ngram_gateway_enabled = True\nhtcondor_gateway_enabled = True\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore information about the Globus GRAM CE can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nBatch System\n\n\nConfiguring the batch system\n\n\nEnable your batch system by editing the \nenabled\n field in the\n\n/etc/osg/config.d/20-YOUR-BATCH-SYSTEM.ini\n\nfile:\n\n\nenabled = True\n\n\n\n\nBatch systems other than HTCondor\n\n\nIf you are using HTCondor as your \nlocal batch system\n (i.e., in\naddition to your HTCondor CE), skip to the \nconfiguring\nauthorization\n section. For other batch\nsystems (e.g., PBS, LSF, SGE, SLURM), keep reading.\n\n\nSharing the spool directory\n\n\nTo transfer files between the CE and the batch system, HTCondor CE\nrequires a shared file system. The current recommendation is to run a\ndedicated NFS server (whose installation is beyond the scope of this\ndocument) on the \nCE host\n. In this setup, HTCondor-CE writes to the\nlocal spool directory, the NFS server exports the it, and the NFS server\nshares the it with all of the worker nodes.\n\n\nNOTE\n: If you choose not to host the NFS\nserver on your CE, you will need to turn off root squash so that the\nHTCondor-CE daemons can write to the spool directory.\n\n\nBy default, the spool directory is \n/var/lib/condor-ce\n but you can\ncontrol this by setting \nSPOOL\n in\n\n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n. For example, the following sets\nthe \nSPOOL\n directory to \n/home/condor\n:\n\n\nSPOOL=/home/condor\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n: The shared spool directory must\nbe readable and writeable by the \ncondor\n user for HTCondor CE to\nfunction correctly.\n\n\nDisable worker node proxy renewal\n\n\nWorker node proxy renewal is not used by HTCondor-CE and leaving it on\nwill cause some jobs to be held. Edit \n/etc/blah.config\n on the\nHTCondor CE host and set the following two values:\n\n\nblah_disable_wn_proxy_renewal=yes\nblah_delegate_renewed_proxies=no\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n: This configuration file uses bash syntax rules; there should be no whitespace around the \n=\n.\n\n\nConfiguring authorization\n\n\nThere are two methods to manage authorization for incoming jobs,\n\nedg-mkgridmap\n and GUMS. \nedg-mkgridmap\n is easy to set up and maintain,\nand GUMS has more features and capabilities. We recommend using\n\nedg-mkgridmap\n unless you have specific needs that require the use of\nGUMS. Some examples of these specific requirements are:\n\n\n\n\nYou want to map users based on rules\n\n\nYou need to support multiple VO roles\n\n\nYou need to support gLExec for pilot jobs\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization with edg-mkgridmap\n\n\nTo configure your CE to use \nedg-mkgridmap\n:\n\n\n\n\nFollow the configuration instructions in \nthe edg-mkgridmap\n    document\n to define the VOs that your site\n    accepts\n\n\n\n\nSet some critical gridmap attributes by editing the\n    \n/etc/osg/config.d/10-misc.ini\n file on the HTCondor CE\n    host:\n\n\nauthorization_method = gridmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable edg-mkgridmap and disable GUMS in the \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n\n    file.\n\n\nIn the \nauthorize_only\n section, comment out the\n\ngumsclient\n line and uncomment the \ngridmapfile\n line. The result\nshould be as follows:\n\n\nauthorize_only:\n # gumsclient -\n good | bad\n gridmapfile -\n good | bad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecify the location of your grid mapfile in\n    \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/01-common-auth.conf\n:\n\n\nGRIDMAP = /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile\n\n\nNote:\n The standard location for the grid mapfile is shown\nabove. Use that location unless you have specific reasons to put the\nfile somewhere else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization with GUMS\n\n\n\n\nFollow the instructions in \nthe GUMS installation and\n    configuration document\n to prepare GUMS\n\n\n\n\nSet some critical GUMS attributes by editing the\n    \n/etc/osg/config.d/10-misc.ini\n file on the HTCondor CE\n    host:\n\n\nauthorization_method = xacml\ngums_host = YOUR GUMS HOSTNAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOnce \ngsi-authz.conf\n is in place,\nyour local HTCondor will attempt to utilize the LCMAPS callouts if\nenabled in the \ncondor_mapfile\n. If this is not the desired behavior, set\n\nGSI_AUTHZ_CONF=/dev/null\n in the local HTCondor configuration.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring information systems\n\n\nTo split jobs between the various sites of the OSG, information about\neach site\u2019s availability is uploaded to a central collector. The job\nfactories then query the central collector for idle resources and submit\npilot jobs to the available sites. To advertise your site, you will need\nto run the Generic Information Provider and OSG Info Services.\n\n\nGeneric Information Provider (GIP)\n\n\nThe \nGIP\n is a service that discovers information about your site\nresources like the number of available cores and what VO's are allowed\nto run on your site. Consult the \nGIP configuration\ndocument\n for instructions on\nhow to set up your \nGIP\n service.\n\n\nNOTE\n: If you have \ngip-1.3.11-4\n\ninstalled, manual intervention is required for correct reporting to\nBDII. See \n3.2.20 known\nissues\n.\n\n\nOSG Info Services\n\n\nosg-info-services\n takes the information collected from \nGIP\n and\nuploads it to OSG's central collector. For \nosg-info-services\n to\ncommunicate with the appropriate servers, it needs a service certificate\nand key located at \n/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem\n and\n\n/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem\n, respectively. Additionally, the\nservice runs as either the \ntomcat\n user or the account specified by the\n\nuser\n option in \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-gip.ini\n, thus your service\ncertificates need to be owned by the appropriate user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable osg-info-services in\n    \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-infoservices.ini\n:\n\n\nenabled = *True*\n\n2.  Generate a \nuser-vo-map\n file with your authorization set\nup:\ni.  If you're using edg-mkgridmap, run the following:\n\n\nedg-mkgridmap\n\nii. If you're using GUMS, run the following:\n\n\ngums-host-cron\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying configuration settings\n\n\nMaking changes to the OSG configuration files in the \n/etc/osg/config.d\n\ndirectory does not apply those settings to software automatically.\nSettings that are made outside of the OSG directory take effect\nimmediately or at least when the relevant service is restarted. For the\nOSG settings, use the \nosg-configure\n tool to\nvalidate (to a limited extent) and apply the settings to the relevant\nsoftware components. The \nosg-configure\n software is included\nautomatically in an HTCondor CE installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake all changes to \n.ini\n files in the \n/etc/osg/config.d\n\n    directory\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis document describes the\ncritical settings for HTCondor CE and related software. You may need\nto configure other software that is installed on your HTCondor CE\nhost, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidate the configuration settings\n\n\nosg-configure -v\n\n\nFix any errors (at least) that \nosg-configure\n reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the validation command succeeds without errors, apply the\n    configuration settings:\n\n\nosg-configure -c\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional configuration\n\n\nThe following configuration steps are optional and will likely not be\nrequired for setting up a small site. If you do not need any of the\nfollowing special configurations, skip to \nthe section on using\nHTCondor CE\n.\n\n\n\n\nTransforming and filtering jobs\n\n\nConfiguring for multiple network interfaces\n\n\nLimiting or disabling locally running jobs on the CE\n\n\nHTCondor accounting groups\n\n\nInstalling the HTCondor-CE View\n\n\n\n\nTransforming and filtering jobs\n\n\nIf you need to modify or filter jobs, more information can be found in\nthe \nJob Router Recipes\n\ndocument.\n\n\nNOTE\n: If you need to assign jobs to\nHTCondor accounting groups, refer to \nthis\n section.\n\n\nConfiguring for multiple network interfaces\n\n\nIf you have multiple network interfaces with different hostnames, the\nHTCondor CE daemons need to know which hostname to use when\ncommunicating to each other. Generally, you will want to set\n\nNETWORK_HOSTNAME\n to the hostname of your public interface in\n\n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n directory with the line:\n\n\nNETWORK_HOSTNAME=condorce.example.com\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ncondorce.example.com\n text with your public\ninterface\u2019s hostname.\n\n\nLimiting or disabling locally jobs running on the CE\n\n\nIf you want to limit or disable jobs running locally on your CE, you\nwill need to configure HTCondor-CE's local and scheduler universes.\nLocal and scheduler universes are HTCondor CE\u2019s analogue to GRAM\u2019s\nmanaged fork: they allow jobs to be run on the CE itself. The two\nuniverses are effectively the same (scheduler universe launches a\nstarter process for each job), so we will be configuring them in unison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the default limit\n on the number of locally run jobs\n    (the current default is 20), add the following to\n    \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n:\n\n\nLOCAL_JOB_LIMIT = 20\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = TotalLocalJobsRunning + TotalSchedulerJobsRunning \n $(LOCAL_JOB_LIMIT)\nSTART_SCHEDULER_UNIVERSE = $(START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE)\n\n\n(updating \nLOCAL_JOB_LIMIT\n as appropriate.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo only allow a specific user\n to start locally run jobs, add the\n    following to \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n:\n\n\nALLOWED_LOCAL_USER=alice\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = target.Owner =?= \"$(ALLOWED_LOCAL_USER)\"\nSTART_SCHEDULER_UNIVERSE = $(START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo disable\n locally run jobs, add the following to\n    \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n:\n\n\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = False\nSTART_SCHEDULER_UNIVERSE = $(START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n: RSV requires the ability to start\nlocal universe jobs so if you are using RSV, you need to allow local\nuniverse jobs from the \nrsv\n user.\n\n\nHTCondor accounting groups\n\n\nNOTE\n: For HTCondor batch systems only\n\n\nIf you want to provide fairshare on a group basis, as opposed to a Unix\nuser basis, you can use HTCondor accounting groups. They are independent\nof the Unix groups the user may already be in, and are \ndocumented in the HTCondor manual\n.\nIf you are using HTCondor accounting groups, you can map jobs from the\nCE into HTCondor accounting groups based on their numeric user id, their\nDN, or their VOMS attributes.\n\n\nMapping by UID\n\n\nTo map UID\u2019s to an accounting group, use \n/etc/osg/uid_table.txt\n. It is\nconsulted first and contains lines of the form:\n\n\nuid GroupName\n\n\n\n\nExample \nuid_table.txt\n:\n\n\nuscms02 TestGroup\nosg     other.osgedu\n\n\n\n\nMapping by DN or VOMS attribute\n\n\nTo map DN\u2019s or VOMS attributes to an accounting group, use\n\n/etc/osg/extattr_table.txt\n. This file is only consulted if the user is\nnot found in the UID file and it contains lines of the form:\n\n\nSubjectOrAttribute GroupName\n\n\n\n\nThe SubjectOrAttribute can be a Perl regular\nexpression.\n\n\nExample \nextattr_table.txt\n:\n\n\ncmsprio cms.other.prio\ncms\\/Role=production cms.prod\n.* other\n\n\n\n\nInstall and run the HTCondor-CE-View\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE-View is an optional web interface to the status of your\nCE. To run the View,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBegin by installing the package htcondor-ce-view:\n\n\nyum install htcondor-ce-view\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, uncomment the \nDAEMON_LIST\n configuration located at\n    \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/05-ce-view.conf\n:\n\n\nDAEMON_LIST = $(DAEMON_LIST), CEVIEW, GANGLIAD\n]]]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the CE service.\n\n\nservice condor-ce restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the website is served from port 80.

The version of frontier-squid installed should be \n= 2.7.STABLE9-19.1\n\n\nAbout Frontier Squid\n\n\nFrontier Squid is a distribution of the well-known \nsquid HTTP caching\nproxy software\n that is optimized for use with\napplications on the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG). It has \nmany\nadvantages\n\nover regular squid for common grid applications, especially Frontier and\nCVMFS.\n\n\nThe OSG distribution of frontier-squid is a straight rebuild of the\nupstream frontier-squid package for the convenience of OSG users.\n\n\nFrontier Squid is Recommended\n\n\nOSG recommends that all sites run a caching proxy for HTTP and HTTPS to\nhelp reduce bandwidth and improve throughput. To that end, Compute\nElement (CE) installations include Frontier Squid automatically. We\nencourage all sites to configure and use this service, as described\nbelow.\n\n\nFor large sites that expect heavy load on the proxy, it may be best to\nrun the proxy on its own host. In that case, the Frontier Squid software\nstill will be installed on the CE, but it need not be enabled. Instead,\ninstall your proxy service on the separate host and then configure the\nCE host to refer to the proxy on that host.\n\n\nThe \nosg-configure\n configuration tool (version 1.0.45 and later) warns\nusers who have not added the proxy location to their CE configuration.\nIn the future, a proxy will be required and osg-configure will fail if\nthe proxy location is not set.\n\n\nEngineering Considerations\n\n\nIf you will be supporting the Frontier application at your site, review\nthe \nupstream documentation Hardware considerations\nsection\n\nto determine how to size your equipment.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nHost and OS\n\n\n\n\nOS is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, and variants\n\n\nRoot access\n\n\n\n\nUsers The frontier-squid installation will create one user account\n\n\nunless it already exists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsquid\n\n\nReduced privilege user that the squid process runs under. Set the default gid of the \u201csquid\u201d user to be a group that is also called \u201csquid\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe package can instead use another user name of your choice if you\ncreate a configuration file before installation. Details are in the\n\nupstream documentation Preparation\nsection\n.\n\n\nNetworking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService Name\n\n\nProtocol\n\n\nPort Number\n\n\nInbound\n\n\nOutbound\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSquid\n\n\ntcp\n\n\n3128\n\n\n\u2713\n\n\n\u2713\n\n\nAlso limited in squid ACLs.

Just be sure to run it once before starting CE services.\n\n\n\n\nStarting and Stopping the Frontier Squid Service\n\n\nStarting frontier-squid:\n\n\nUCL_ROOT_PROMPT\n service frontier-squid start\n\n\n\n\nStopping frontier-squid:\n\n\nUCL_ROOT_PROMPT\n service frontier-squid stop\n\n\n\n\nTesting Frontier Squid\n\n\nAs any user on another computer, do the following (where\n\nyoursquid.your.domain\n is\nthe fully qualified domain name of your squid server):\n\n\n[user@client ~]$ export http_proxy=http://yoursquid.your.domain:3128\n[user@client ~]$ wget -qdO/dev/null http://frontier.cern.ch 2\n1|grep X-Cache\nX-Cache: MISS from yoursquid.your.domain\n[user@client ~]$ wget -qdO/dev/null http://frontier.cern.ch 2\n1|grep X-Cache\nX-Cache: HIT from yoursquid.your.domain\n\n\n\n\nIf the grep doesn\u2019t print anything, try removing it from the pipeline to\nsee if errors are obvious. If the second try says \nMISS\n again, something\nis probably wrong with the squid cache writes.\n\n\nIf your squid will be supporting the Frontier application, it is also\ngood to do the test in the \nupstream documentation Testing the\ninstallation\nsection\n.\n\n\nFrontier Squid Log Files\n\n\nLog file contents are explained in the \nupstream documentation Log file\ncontents section\n.\n\n\nGetting Help\n\n\nTo get assistance please use \nHelp Procedure\n.",

For large sites that expect heavy load on the proxy, it may be best to\nrun the proxy on its own host.

In addition, if the fuse rpm is not for some reason already installed, installing cvmfs will also install fuse and that will create another group:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\n\n\nComment\n\n\nGroup members\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncvmfs\n\n\nCernVM-FS service account\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfuse\n\n\nFUSE service account\n\n\ncvmfs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworking\n\n\nYou will need network access to a local squid server such as the \nsquid distributed by OSG\n. The squid will need out-bound access to cvmfs stratum 1 servers.\n\n\nUpgrading\n\n\nWhen upgrading to cvmfs 2.1.20, delete the setting of \nCVMFS_SERVER_URL\n in \n/etc/cvmfs/domain.d/cern.ch.local\n. If that's the only thing in the file (which is likely) then delete the whole file.\n\n\nWhen upgrading from a cvmfs 2.0.X version, all \n/cvmfs\n repositories must be unmounted in order to upgrade. When upgrading between 2.1.X versions, repositories may be mounted.\n\n\nNote that version 2.1 removed the \n/etc/init.d/cvmfs\n script. Starting it didn't actually do anything anyway (it is automatically starts when mounted), and the stop function has been moved to \ncvmfs_config umount\n.\nThe \nrestartautofs\n function is instead done by \nservice autofs restart\n. The \nprobe\n function has also been moved to \ncvmfs_config probe\n. Since 2.1.X enables shared cache by default, so in order to reclaim the previous cache space when upgrading from 2.0.X you must manually remove the old caches. For example\n\n\nrm -rf /var/cache/cvmfs/*.*\n\n\n\n\nInstall Instructions\n\n\nPrior to installing CVMFS, make sure the \nyum repositories\n are correctly configured for OSG.\n\n\nThe following will install cvmfs from the OSG repository. It will also install cern public keys as well as fuse and autofs if you do not have them, and it will install the configuration for the OSG CVMFS distribution, OASIS.\n\n\nyum install osg-oasis\n\n\n\n\nCreate or edit \n/etc/fuse.conf\n. It should contain the following in order to allow fuse to do proper file ownership:\n\n\nuser_allow_other\n\n\n\n\nCreate or edit \n/etc/auto.master\n. It should contain the following in order to allow cvmfs to automount:\n\n\n/cvmfs /etc/auto.cvmfs\n\n\n\n\nRestart autofs to make the change take effect:\n\n\nservice autofs restart\nStopping automount:                       [  OK  ]\nStarting automount:                       [  OK  ]\n\n\n\n\nCreate or edit \n/etc/cvmfs/default.local\n, a file that controls the cvmfs configuration.\nBelow is a sample configuration, \nbut please note\n that you will need to customize this for your site. (In particular, the \nCVMFS_HTTP_PROXY\n line below only works within the .fnal.gov domain.)\n\n\nCVMFS_REPOSITORIES=\n`echo $((echo oasis.opensciencegrid.org;echo cms.cern.ch;ls /cvmfs)|sort -u)|tr ' ' ,`\n\nCVMFS_CACHE_BASE=/var/cache/cvmfs\nCVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT=20000\nCVMFS_HTTP_PROXY=\nhttp://squid.fnal.gov:3128\n\n\n\n\n\nCVMFS 2.1 by default allows any repository to be mounted. The recommended CVMFS_REPOSITORIES setting is what it is above so that tools such as \ncvmfs_config\n and \ncvmfs_talk\n that use known repositories will use two common repositories plus any additional that have been mounted. You may want to choose a different set of always-known repositories. A full list of cern.ch repositories is found at \nhttp://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/cvmfs/examples\n. The only opensciencegrid.org repository is currently oasis.\n\n\nSet up a list of cvmfs HTTP proxies to retrieve from in CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY. Vertical bars separating proxies means to load balance between them and try them all before continuing. A semicolon between proxies means to try that one only after the previous ones have failed. A special proxy called DIRECT can be placed last in the list to indicate directly connecting to servers if all other proxies fail. This is acceptable for small sites but discouraged for large sites because of the potential load that could be put upon the stratum one servers.\n\n\nSet up the cache limit in \nCVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT\n (in MB). Recommended for most applications is 20GB. This is the combined limit for all repositories. This cache will be stored in \n$CVMFS_CACHE_BASE\n. Make sure that at least 20% more than that amount of space stays available for cvmfs in that filesystem. This is very important, since if that space is not available it can cause many I/O errors and application crashes. Many system administrators choose to put the cache space in a separate filesystem.\n\n\nVerifying cvmfs\n\n\nAfter CVMFS is installed, you should be able to see the \n/cvmfs\n directory. But note that it will initially appear to be empty:\n\n\n$ ls /cvmfs\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectories within \n/cvmfs\n will not be mounted until you examine them. For instance:\n\n\n# ls -l /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch\n/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch:\ntotal 5\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 cvmfs cvmfs 4096 Mar  5  2012 repo\n# ls -l /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/cmssoft\n/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/cmssoft:\ntotal 1\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 cvmfs cvmfs 18 May 28 10:33 cms -\n /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch\n# ls -l /cvmfs/glast.egi.eu\ntotal 5\ndrwxr-xr-x 9 cvmfs cvmfs 4096 Feb  7  2014 glast\n# ls /cvmfs\natlas.cern.ch  cms.cern.ch  glast.egi.eu  oasis.opensciencegrid.org\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting problems\n\n\nIf no directories exist under \n/cvmfs/\n, you can try the following steps to debug:\n\n\n\n\nMount it manually \nmkdir /mnt/cvmfs\n then \nmount -t cvmfs REPOSITORYNAME /mnt/cvmfs\n where \nREPOSITORYNAME\n is the repository, for example \noasis.opensciencegrid.org\n. If this works, then cvmfs is working, but there is a problem with automount.\n\n\nIf that doesn't work and doesn't give any explanatory errors, try \ncvmfs_config chksetup\n or \ncvmfs_config showconfig REPOSITORYNAME\n to verify your setup.\n\n\nIf chksetup reports access problems to proxies, it may be caused by access control settings in the squids.\n\n\nIf you have changed settings in \n/etc/cvmfs/default.local\n, and they do not seem to be taking effect, note that there are other configuration files that can override the settings. See the comments at the beginning of \n/etc/cvmfs/default.conf\n regarding the order in which configuration files are evaluated and look for old files that may have been left from a previous installation.\n\n\nMore things to try are in the \nupstream documentation\n.\n\n\n\n\nStarting and Stopping services\n\n\nOnce it is set up, cvmfs is always automatically started when one of the repositories are accessed.\n\n\ncvmfs can be stopped via:\n\n\n# cvmfs_config umount\nUnmounting /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch: OK\nUnmounting /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org: OK\nUnmounting /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch: OK\nUnmounting /cvmfs/glast.egi.eu: OK\n\n\n\n\nScreendump of Install\n\n\n[root@fermicloud044 ~]# rpm -Uvh

It will also install cern public keys as well as fuse and autofs if you do not have them, and it will install the configuration for the OSG CVMFS distribution, OASIS.  yum install osg-oasis  Create or edit  /etc/fuse.conf . It should contain the following in order to allow fuse to do proper file ownership:  user_allow_other  Create or edit  /etc/auto.master . It should contain the following in order to allow cvmfs to automount:  /cvmfs /etc/auto.cvmfs  Restart autofs to make the change take effect:  service autofs restart\nStopping automount:                       [  OK  ]\nStarting automount:                       [  OK  ]  Create or edit  /etc/cvmfs/default.local , a file that controls the cvmfs configuration.\nBelow is a sample configuration,  but please note  that you will need to customize this for your site. (In particular, the  CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY  line below only works within the .fnal.gov domain.)  CVMFS_REPOSITORIES= `echo $((echo oasis.opensciencegrid.org;echo cms.cern.ch;ls /cvmfs)|sort -u)|tr ' ' ,` \nCVMFS_CACHE_BASE=/var/cache/cvmfs\nCVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT=20000\nCVMFS_HTTP_PROXY= http://squid.fnal.gov:3128   CVMFS 2.1 by default allows any repository to be mounted. The recommended CVMFS_REPOSITORIES setting is what it is above so that tools such as  cvmfs_config  and  cvmfs_talk  that use known repositories will use two common repositories plus any additional that have been mounted. You may want to choose a different set of always-known repositories. A full list of cern.ch repositories is found at  http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/cvmfs/examples . The only opensciencegrid.org repository is currently oasis.  Set up a list of cvmfs HTTP proxies to retrieve from in CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY. Vertical bars separating proxies means to load balance between them and try them all before continuing. A semicolon between proxies means to try that one only after the previous ones have failed. A special proxy called DIRECT can be placed last in the list to indicate directly connecting to servers if all other proxies fail. This is acceptable for small sites but discouraged for large sites because of the potential load that could be put upon the stratum one servers.  Set up the cache limit in  CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT  (in MB). Recommended for most applications is 20GB. This is the combined limit for all repositories. This cache will be stored in  $CVMFS_CACHE_BASE . Make sure that at least 20% more than that amount of space stays available for cvmfs in that filesystem. This is very important, since if that space is not available it can cause many I/O errors and application crashes. Many system administrators choose to put the cache space in a separate filesystem.",

If this works, then cvmfs is working, but there is a problem with automount.  If that doesn't work and doesn't give any explanatory errors, try  cvmfs_config chksetup  or  cvmfs_config showconfig REPOSITORYNAME  to verify your setup.  If chksetup reports access problems to proxies, it may be caused by access control settings in the squids.  If you have changed settings in  /etc/cvmfs/default.local , and they do not seem to be taking effect, note that there are other configuration files that can override the settings. See the comments at the beginning of  /etc/cvmfs/default.conf  regarding the order in which configuration files are evaluated and look for old files that may have been left from a previous installation.

If you are using a configuration management system or ROCKS, you should make sure that these users and groups are created before installing the RPMs to avoid potential issues. The gsisshd user should have an empty home directory. By default, this is home directory set to \n/var/empty/gsisshd\n and belongs to the \ngsisshd\n user and group. You may change it if needed to something else as long as the ownerships remain the same.\n\n\nNetworking\n\n\nYou'll find more client specific details also in the \nFirewall section\n of this document.\n\n\nInstallation procedure\n\n\nPrior to install, make sure you have:\n\n \nYum repositories correctly configured\n for OSG.\n\n \nCA certificates installed\n\n\nGSI OpenSSH Installation\n\n\nStart with installing GSI OpenSSH from the repository\n\n\nyum install gsi-openssh-server gsi-openssh-clients\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, you'll need to install CA certificates in order for GSIOpenSSH to work.

However, before you go any\nfurther, you'll need to decide whether you want GSI OpenSSH to be your \nprimary ssh service or not (e.g. whether the GSI OpenSSH service will \nreplace your existing SSH service). If you choose not to replace your \nexisting service, you'll need to change the port setting in the GSI \nOpenSSH configuration to another port (e.g. 2222) so that you can run \nboth SSH services at the same time. Regardless of your choice, you \nshould probably have both services use the same host key. In order \nto do this, symlink \n/etc/gsissh/ssh_host_dsa_key\n and \n/etc/gsissh/ssh_host_rsa_key\n \nto \n/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key\n and \n/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key\n respectively. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nRegardless of the authorization method used for the user, any \naccount that will be used with GSI OpenSSH must have a shell \nassigned to it and not be locked (have ! in the password field of \n/etc/shadow\n).\n\n\n\n\nUsing a gridmap file for authorization\n\n\nIn order to use gsissh, you'll need to create mappings in your \n\n/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile\n for the DNs that you will \nallow to login. The mappings should be entered one to a line, \nwith each line consisting of DN followed by the account the DN \nshould map to. Also, you should ensure that the \n\n/etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf\n file is empty or that all \nof the lines in the file are commented out using a \n#\n at the beginning of the line.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe mappings will not consider VOMS extensions so the first mapping that matches will be used regardless of the VO role or VO present in the users proxy\n\n\n\n\nAn example of the \n/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile\n follows:\n\n\n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=USER NAME 123456\n useraccount\n\n\n\n\nUsing LCMAPS and GUMS for authorization\n\n\nIn order to use LCMAPS callouts with GSI OpenSSH, you'll first need to edit \n/etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf\n to indicate that Globus should do a GSI callout for authorization. The file should contain the following:\n\n\nglobus_mapping liblcas_lcmaps_gt4_mapping.so lcmaps_callout\n\n\n\n\nso that LCMAPS is used. Next, install the lcmaps rpms:\n\n\nyum install lcmaps lcas-lcmaps-gt4-interface\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you'll need to modify \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n so that the \ngumsclient\n entry has the correct endpoint for your gums server.\n\n\nStarting and Enabling Services\n\n\nTo start the services:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo start GSI OpenSSH you can use the service command, e.g.:\n\n\nservice gsisshd start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should also enable the appropriate services so that they are automatically started when your system is powered on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable OpenSSH by default on the node:\n\n\nchkconfig gsisshd on\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStopping and Disabling Services\n\n\nTo stop the services:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo stop OpenSSH you can use: \\\npre class=\u201crootscreen\u201d>\n\n\nservice gsisshd stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, you can disable services by running the following commands. However, you don't need to do this normally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptionally, to disable OpenSSH:\n\n\nchkconfig gsisshd off\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nYou can get information on troubleshooting errors on the \nNCSA page\n.\n\n\nTo troubleshoot LCMAPS authorization, you can add the following to \n/etc/sysconfig/gsisshd\n and choose a higher debug level:\n\n\n# level 0: no messages, 1: errors, 2: also warnings, 3: also notices,\n#  4: also info, 5: maximum debug\nLCMAPS_DEBUG_LEVEL=2\n\n\n\n\nOutput goes to \n/var/log/messages\n by default.\n\n\nTest GSI OpenSSH\n\n\nAfter starting the \ngsisshd\n service you can check if it is running correctly\n\n\n$ grid-proxy-init\nYour identity: /DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=Organic Units/OU=Users/CN=User Name\nEnter GRID pass phrase for this identity:\nCreating proxy ...............................................................................................

            "text": "Glexec Installation Guide\n\n\nThis document is intended for System Administrators that are installing the OSG version of glexec.\n\n\nGlexec is commonly used for what are referred to as \u201cpilot\u201d or \u201cglidein\u201d jobs.\n\n\nTraditionally, users submitted their jobs directly to a remote site (or compute element gatekeeper). The user job was authenticated/authorized to run at that site based on the user\u2019s proxy credentials and run under the local unix account assigned.\n\n\nIn a pilot-based infrastructure, users submit their jobs to a centralized site (or queue). The pilot/glidein software at the centralized site then recognizes there is a demand for computing resources. It will then submit what is called a pilot/glidein job to a remote site. This pilot job gets authenticated/authorized to run on a worker node in that site\u2019s cluster. It will then \u201cpull\u201d down user jobs from the centralized queue and execute them. Both the pilot and the user job are run under the pilot job\u2019s proxy certificate credentials and local unix account. This represents a security problem in pilot-based systems as there is no authentication/authorization of the individual user\u2019s proxy credentials and, thus, the user\u2019s jobs do not run using it\u2019s own local unix account.\n\n\nGlexec is a security tool that can be used to resolve this problem. It is meant to be used by VOs that run these pilot-based jobs. It has a number of authentication plugins and can be used both by European grid and by OSG.\n\n\nThe pilot job will \u201cpull\u201d user jobs down from the central queue and invoke glexec which will then\n\n\n\n\nauthenticate the user job\u2019s proxy,\n\n\nperform an authorization callout (to GUMS in the case of OSG, or possibly a gridmapfile) similar to that done by the gatekeeper,\n\n\nand then run the user job under the local account assigned by the authorization service for that user.\n\n\n\n\nIn effect, glexec functions much the same as a compute element gatekeeper, except these functions are now performed on the individual worker node. The pilot jobs authentication/authorization is done by the gatekeeper and the individual user jobs are now done by glexec on the individual worker node.\n\n\nMany worker node clusters use shared file systems like NFS for much of their software and user home accounts. Since glexec is an suid program, it must be installed on every single worker node individually. Most shared file systems do not handle this correctly so it cannot and must not be NFS-exported.\n\n\nFor more information regarding pilot-based systems and glexec:\n\n\n\n\nglideinWMS - The glidein based WMS\n\n\nAddressing the pilot security problem with gLExec (pdf)\n\n\n\n\nEngineering Considerations\n\n\nThis section describes any prerequisite software/considerations that must be taken into account before the glexec software installation is performed. It should be reviewed completely before starting the installation process.\n\n\nA large number of batch slots using glexec can occasionally put an enormous strain on GUMS servers and cause overloading and client timeouts. In order to survive peak loads, the sysctl parameter \u2018net.core.somaxconn\u2019 on a GUMS server machine should be set at least as high as the maximum number of job slots that might attempt to contact the server at about the same time. (For example, Fermilab set the value to 4096 on each of two servers and tested with a continuous load from 5000 job slots). At the same time, the Apache parameter \u2018ListenBacklog\u2019 must be changed to the same value. Also note that Fermilab determined that for best performance, the Apache parameter \u2018MaxClients\u2019 on GUMS servers (at least on their dual-core Virtual Machines) should be set to a value of 32. For details on these and other parameters on the GUMS server see GumsScalability.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nThese are the requirements that must be met to install glexec.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNormally you will install the \nOSG worker node\n first. Technically, installing the \nosg-wn-client-glexec\n package will also install the worker node, but we do not duplicate instructions specific to the worker node here, so refer to the \nOSG worker node\n for details about the worker node installation.\n\n\n\n\nHost and OS\n\n\n\n\nOS is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, and variants.\n\n\nRoot access\n\n\n\n\nUsers\n\n\nThe glexec installation will create two users unless they are already created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nglexec\n\n\nReduced privilege separate id used to improve security. Set the default gid of the \u201cglexec\u201d user to be a group that is also called \u201cglexec\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngratia\n\n\nNeeded for the glexec gratia probe which is also automatically installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, OSG glexec requires a range of \ngroup ids\n for tracking purposes. You don\u2018t actually have to create the group entries but it is recommended to do so in order to reserve the gids and so they can be associated with names in the \n/usr/bin/id\n command. The recommended names are \u2019glexecNN\u2019 where NN is a number starting from 00.\n\n\n\n\nDefine at least 4 group ids per batch slot per worker node. A conservative way to handle this is to multiply the number of batch slots on the largest worker node by 6 and then share the group ids between all the worker nodes.\n\n\nThey must be consecutive and in any range (default range is 65000-65049, configured in the \nConfiguring glexec\n section below).\n\n\nThe same group ids can be used on every worker node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Instructions\n\n\nPrior to installing \nglexec\n, verify the \nyum repositories\n are correctly configured.\n\n\nSome of the worker node client software verifies proxies or certificates. In order to do this, they will need the \nCA certificates\n used to sign the proxies.\n\n\nInstall glexec\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe glexec tracking function requires a part of HTCondor. There are multiple ways to install HTCondor, for details see \nthese instructions\n. If you want a minimal install, you can run just this command to install the needed piece from the OSG distribution:\n\n\nyum install condor-procd\n\n\n\n\nAfter meeting all the requirements in the previous section, install glexec with this command:\n\n\nyum install osg-wn-client-glexec\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring glexec\n\n\nThe following steps need to be done after the glexec installation is complete.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, review the contents of \n/etc/glexec.conf\n. All of the defaults should be fine, but if you want to change the behavior, the parameters are described in \nman glexec.conf\n.\n\n\n\n\nNext, review all of the contents of \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n and in particular update the following pieces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have GUMS, change the yourgums.yourdomain in the following line to the fully qualified domain name of your GUMS server:\n\n\n\"\u2013endpoint \nhttps://yourgums.yourdomain:8443/gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to use a range of tracking group ids other than the default as described in the \nRequirements\n section above, uncomment and change the \n-min-gid\n and \n-max-gid\n lines to your chosen values:\n\n\n\"-min-gid 65000\u201d \u201c-max-gid 65049\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncomment the following two lines:\n\n\nglexectracking = \"lcmaps_glexec_tracking.mod\"\n                   \"-exec /usr/sbin/glexec_monitor\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have GUMS, uncomment the following policy toward the end of the file:\n\n\nverifyproxy -\n gumsclient\n gumsclient -\n glexectracking\n\n\nor if you have do not have GUMS and want to use a gridmapfile, uncomment the following policy:\n\n\nverifyproxy -\n gridmapfile\n gridmapfile -\n glexectracking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting the Installation of glexec\n\n\nNow, \nas a non-privileged user (not root)\n , do the following (where \nyourvo\n is your VO, and \nNNN\n is your uid as reported by \n/usr/bin/id\n):\n\n\nvoms-proxy-init -voms yourvo:/yourvo\nexport GLEXEC_CLIENT_CERT=/tmp/x509up_u\nNNN\n\n/usr/sbin/glexec /usr/bin/id\nuid=13160(fnalgrid) gid=9767(fnalgrid) groups=65000(glexec00)\n\n\n\n\nIf your \nlcmaps.db\n is set up to not use a host certificate as described in GlexecPilotCert, you should also set\n\n\nexport X509_USER_PROXY=/tmp/x509up_u\nNNN\n\n\n\n\n\n(substitute \nNNN\n for your UID) before running glexec.\n\n\nIf \nglexec\n is successful, it will print out the uid and gid that your proxy would normally be mapped to by your GUMS server, plus a supplementary tracking group. (The actual names and numbers will be different from what you see above.)\n\n\nIf you have problems, please read about \ntroubleshooting glexec\n.\n\n\nGlexec log files\n\n\nGlexec\n sends all its log information by default to syslog. Where it goes from there depends on your syslog configuration, but by default they go to \n/var/log/messages\n. Here are some sample messages:\n\n\nApr 25 16:36:16 fermicloud053 glexec[2867]: lcmaps: lcmaps.mod-PluginInit(): plugin glexectracking not found (arguments: )\nApr 25 16:36:16 fermicloud053 glexec[2867]: lcmaps: lcmaps.mod-lcmaps_startPluginManager(): error initializing plugin: glexectracking\nApr 25 16:36:16 fermicloud053 glexec[2867]: lcmaps: lcmaps_init() error: could not start plugin manager\nApr 25 16:36:16 fermicloud053 glexec[2867]: Initialisation of LCMAPS failed.\n\n\n\n\nThese particular messages are pretty common, caused by forgetting to uncomment the beginning of the glexectracking rule in \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n.\n\n\nIt is possible to redirect glexec log messages to a different file with standard syslog. To do that, choose one of the \nLOG_LOCAL[0-7]\n log facilities that are unused, for example \nLOG_LOCAL1\n. Then set the following in \n/etc/glexec.conf\n:\n\n\nsyslog_facility = LOG_LOCAL1\n\n\n\n\nand add a corresponding parameter to the \nlcmaps_glexec_tracking.mod\n entry in \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n:\n\n\n  \n-log-facility LOG_LOCAL1\n\n\n\n\n\nThen in \n/etc/syslog.conf\n on el5 or \n/etc/rsyslog.conf\n on el6 add a line like this\n\n\nlocal1.* /var/log/glexec.log\n\n\n\n\nand also exclude those messages from \n/var/log/messages\n by adding \nlocal1.none\n after other wildcards on the existing \n/var/log/messages\n line, for example:\n\n\n*.info;local1.none;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none /var/log/messages\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to notify the system logger to re-read the configuration file with \nservice syslog reload\n on el5, or with \nservice rsyslog restart\n on el6.\n\n\nrsyslog\n, by default, limits the rate at which messages may be logged, and if maximum debugging is enabled in glexec this limit is reached. To avoid that, you can add the following to \n/etc/rsyslog.conf\n after the line \"$ModLoad imuxsock.so\":\n\n\n$SystemLogRateLimitInterval 0\n$SystemLogRateLimitBurst 0\n\n\n\n\nand of course do \nservice rsyslog restart\n.\n\n\nAlternatively, \nsyslog-ng\n (available in the EPEL repository) can do the same job by matching all the messages that have the string \"glexec\" in the name.\nThese rules in \n/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf\n will separate the glexec messages into \n/var/log/glexec.log\n:\n\n\ndestination d_glexec { file(\n/var/log/glexec.log\n); };\nfilter f_glexec { program(\n^glexec\n); };\nfilter f_notglexec { not program(\n^glexec\n); };\nlog { source(s_sys); filter(f_glexec); destination(d_glexec); };\n\n\n\n\nThen later, in the log rule writing sending to \nd_mesg\n, add a \nfilter(f_notglexec);\n before the destination rule to keep glexec messages out of \n/var/log/messages\n:\n\n\nlog { source(s_sys); filter(f_filter1); filter(f_notglexec); destination(d_mesg); };\n\n\n\n\nHow to get Help?\n\n\nTo get assistance please use \nHelp Procedure\n.",

It should be reviewed completely before starting the installation process.  A large number of batch slots using glexec can occasionally put an enormous strain on GUMS servers and cause overloading and client timeouts. In order to survive peak loads, the sysctl parameter \u2018net.core.somaxconn\u2019 on a GUMS server machine should be set at least as high as the maximum number of job slots that might attempt to contact the server at about the same time. (For example, Fermilab set the value to 4096 on each of two servers and tested with a continuous load from 5000 job slots). At the same time, the Apache parameter \u2018ListenBacklog\u2019 must be changed to the same value. Also note that Fermilab determined that for best performance, the Apache parameter \u2018MaxClients\u2019 on GUMS servers (at least on their dual-core Virtual Machines) should be set to a value of 32.

These particular messages are pretty common, caused by forgetting to uncomment the beginning of the glexectracking rule in  /etc/lcmaps.db .  It is possible to redirect glexec log messages to a different file with standard syslog. To do that, choose one of the  LOG_LOCAL[0-7]  log facilities that are unused, for example  LOG_LOCAL1 . Then set the following in  /etc/glexec.conf :  syslog_facility = LOG_LOCAL1  and add a corresponding parameter to the  lcmaps_glexec_tracking.mod  entry in  /etc/lcmaps.db :     -log-facility LOG_LOCAL1   Then in  /etc/syslog.conf  on el5 or  /etc/rsyslog.conf  on el6 add a line like this  local1.* /var/log/glexec.log  and also exclude those messages from  /var/log/messages  by adding  local1.none  after other wildcards on the existing  /var/log/messages  line, for example:  *.info;local1.none;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none /var/log/messages  Be sure to notify the system logger to re-read the configuration file with  service syslog reload  on el5, or with  service rsyslog restart  on el6.  rsyslog , by default, limits the rate at which messages may be logged, and if maximum debugging is enabled in glexec this limit is reached. To avoid that, you can add the following to  /etc/rsyslog.conf  after the line \"$ModLoad imuxsock.so\":  $SystemLogRateLimitInterval 0\n$SystemLogRateLimitBurst 0  and of course do  service rsyslog restart .  Alternatively,  syslog-ng  (available in the EPEL repository) can do the same job by matching all the messages that have the string \"glexec\" in the name.\nThese rules in  /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf  will separate the glexec messages into  /var/log/glexec.log :  destination d_glexec { file( /var/log/glexec.log ); };\nfilter f_glexec { program( ^glexec ); };\nfilter f_notglexec { not program( ^glexec ); };\nlog { source(s_sys); filter(f_glexec); destination(d_glexec); };  Then later, in the log rule writing sending to  d_mesg , add a  filter(f_notglexec);  before the destination rule to keep glexec messages out of  /var/log/messages :  log { source(s_sys); filter(f_filter1); filter(f_notglexec); destination(d_mesg); };",

This package was developed originally by the PPDG project and is now maintained by the OSG RA.\n\n\nAs an alternative to the web browser interface, these scripts are contributed to the DOEGrids PKI to allow a command-line interface to the certificate authority for submitting certificate requests, retrieving signed certificates, renewing certificates, directory lookup of existing certificates, and checking the remaining lifetime of certificates and certificate revocation lists. They work directly with the PEM format files used by Globus. These are perl scripts and bash shell scripts (some awk), depend upon openssl, ldapsearch and the perl LWP:: module with \nSSL support\n.

have a CRL. This is useful AFTER the edg-crl-upgraded daemon has run at least once because then it shows those CA\u2019s which have not published a certificate revocation list. Note that two of the CAs, Kerberos CAs from PSC (85ca9edc.0) and FNAL (e1fce4e9.0) don\u2019t really need CRLs since they only generate short lived certificates.\n\n\nChecking CRL\u2019s\n\n\nCertificate revocation lists contain the list of certificates (by serial number) that have been issued by a CA but were then revoked, meaning you should not accept them. CRL\u2019s are updated frequently and typically have a lifetime limited to a month or less. When a CRL has expired, the CRL file will still exist in the trusted certificates directory, but Globus will fail \nall\n authentication attempts for \nall\n certificates issued by the corresponding CA.\n\n\nFor this reason, and others, it is important that CRL files are current and not expired. Another variation of the cert-check-time script will list the remaining lifetime of CRL\u2019s in the trusted certificates directory. This must be run in a directory where you have write access even though it does not create any files.

They work directly with the PEM format files used by Globus. These are perl scripts and bash shell scripts (some awk), depend upon openssl, ldapsearch and the perl LWP:: module with  SSL support .

            "text": "Writing Routes For HTCondor-CE\n\n\n\n\nAbout This Guide\n\n\nThe \nJobRouter\n is at the heart of HTCondor-CE and allows admins to transform and direct jobs to specific batch systems. Customizations are made in the form of job routes where each route corresponds to a separate job transformation: If an incoming job matches a job route\u2018s requirements, the route creates a transformed job (referred to as the \u2019routed job\u2019) that is then submitted to the batch system. The CE package comes with default routes located in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-*.conf\n that provide enough basic functionality for a small site.\n\n\nIf you have needs beyond delegating all incoming jobs to your batch system as they are, this document provides examples of common job routes and job route problems.\n\n\nRoutePitfalls\n\n\nQuirks and Pitfalls\n\n\n\n\nThe JobRouter matches jobs to routes in a round-robin fashion. This means that if a job can match to multiple routes, it can be routed by any of them! So when writing job routes, make sure that they are exclusive to each other and that your jobs can only match to a single route.\n\n\nIf a value is set in \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n with \neval_set_\nvariable\n, override it by using \neval_set_\nvariable\n in the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n. Do this at your own risk as it may cause the CE to break.\n\n\nMake sure to run \ncondor_ce_reconfig\n after changing your routes, otherwise they will not take effect.\n\n\nBefore the last square bracket, make sure all lines end in a line continuation character (backslash). You can inspect the syntax of your routes with \ncondor_ce_config_val JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n to see if HTCondor-CE has ingested them properly.\n\n\nDo \nnot\n set the \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n configuration variable yourself. This will cause the CE to stop functioning.\n\n\nDo \nnot\n set the job environment through the JobRouter. Instead, add any changes to the /etc/osg/config.d/ \n[Local Settings]\n section and run osg-configure, as documented \nhere\n.\n\n\nHTCondor batch system only: Local universe jobs are excluded from any routing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#JobRouteConstruction\n\n\nHow Job Routes are Constructed\n\n\nEach job route\u2019s \nClassAd\n is constructed by combining each entry from the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n with the \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n. Attributes that are set in \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n will override those set in \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n is a configuration variable whose default is set in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-*.conf\n but may be overriden by the administrator in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n. This document outlines the many changes you can make to \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n to fit your site\u2019s needs.\n\n\n#JobRouterDefaults\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n is a python-generated configuration variable that sets default job route values that are required for the HTCondor-CE\u2019s functionality.

For HTCondor batch systems, the \nTargetUniverse\n attribute needs to be set to \n5\n or \n\"vanilla\"\n. For all other batch systems, the \nTargetUniverse\n attribute needs to be set to \n9\n or \n\"grid\"\n and the \nGridResource\n attribute needs to be set to \n\"batch \nbatch system\n\"\n (where \nbatch system\n can be one of \npbs\n (for both users of \npbs\n and \nSLURM\n), \nlsf\n, or \nsge\n).\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     \nspan style=\nbackground-color: #FFCCFF;\nb\n# Route to an HTCondor-CE batch system \\\n/b\n/span\n\n     \nspan style=\nbackground-color: #FFCCFF;\nb\nTargetUniverse = 5; \\\n/b\n/span\n\n     name = \nRoute jobs to HTCondor\n; \\\n] \\\n[ \\\n     \nspan style=\nbackground-color: #FFCCFF;\nb\n# Route to a PBS batch system \\\n/b\n/span\n\n     \nspan style=\nbackground-color: #FFCCFF;\nb\nGridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n/b\n/span\n\n     \nspan style=\nbackground-color: #FFCCFF;\nb\nTargetUniverse = 9; \\\n/b\n/span\n\n     name = \nRoute jobs to PBS\n; \\\n]\n\n\n\n\nRoute name\n\n\nTo identify routes, you will need to assign a name to the route with the \nname\n attribute:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     \nspan style=\nbackground-color: #FFCCFF;\nb\nname = \nRoute jobs to HTCondor\n; \\\n/b\n/span\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the route will be useful in debugging since it shows up in the output of \ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n, the \nJobRouterLog\n, and in the ClassAd of the routed job, which can be viewed with \ncondor_ce_q\n or \ncondor_ce_history\n.\n\n\nWriting multiple routes\n\n\nIf your batch system needs incoming jobs to be sorted (e.g. if different VO\u2019s need to go to separate queues), you will need to write multiple job routes. Each route is enclosed by square brackets and unless they\u2019re the last closing bracket, they need to be followed by the line continuation character. The following routes takes incoming jobs that have a \nqueue\n attribute set to \n\"analy\"\n and routes them to the site\u2019s HTCondor batch system. Any other jobs will be sent to that site\u2019s PBS batch system.\n\n\n The JobRouter matches jobs to routes in a round-robin fashion. This means that if a job can match to multiple routes, it can be routed by any of them! So when writing job routes, make sure that they are exclusive to each other and that your jobs can only match to a single route.\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = \nspan style=\nbackground-color: #FFCCFF;\nb\n[ \\\n/b\n/span\n\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nRoute jobs to HTCondor\n; \\\n     Requirements = (TARGET.queue =?= \nanaly\n); \\\n\nspan style=\nbackground-color: #FFCCFF;\nb\n] \\\n/b\n/span\n\n\nspan style=\nbackground-color: #FFCCFF;\nb\n[ \\\n/b\n/span\n\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nRoute jobs to PBS\n; \\\n     Requirements = (TARGET.queue =!= \nanaly\n); \\\n\nspan style=\nbackground-color: #FFCCFF;\nb\n]\n/b\n/span\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting comments\n\n\nTo write comments you can use C-style comments, text enclosed by \n/* */\n.

Jobs will evaluate against the ClassAd expression set in the \nRequirements\n and if the expression evaluates to \nTRUE\n, the route will match. More information on the syntax of ClassAd's can be found in the \nHTCondor manual\n. For an example on how incoming jobs interact with filtering in job routes, consult \nthis document\n.\n\n\nWhen setting requirements, you need to prefix job attributes that you are filtering with \nTARGET.\n so that the job route knows to compare the attribute of the incoming job rather than the route\u2019s own attribute. For example, if an incoming job has a =queue = \u201canaly\u201d= attribute, then the following job route will not match:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nFiltering by queue\n; \\\n     queue = \nnot-analy\n; \\\n     \nspan style=\nbackground-color: #FFCCFF;\nb\nRequirements = (TARGET.queue =?= \nanaly\n); \\\n/b\n/span\n\n] \n\n\n\n\nThis is because when evaluating the route requirement, the job route will compare its own \nqueue\n attribute to \u201canaly\u201d and see that it does not match. You can read more about comparing two ClassAds in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\n If you have an HTCondor batch system, note the difference with \nset_requirements\n. \n The JobRouter matches jobs to routes in a round-robin fashion. This means that if a job can match to multiple routes, it can be routed by any of them! So when writing job routes, make sure that they are exclusive to each other and that your jobs can only match to a single route.\n\n\n#GlideIn\n\n\nGlidein queue\n\n\nTo filter jobs based on their glidein queue attribute, your routes will need a \nRequirements\n expression using the incoming job\u2019s \nqueue\n attribute. The following entry routes jobs to the PBS queue if the incoming job (specified by \nTARGET\n) is an \nanaly\n (Analysis) glidein:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nFiltering by queue\n; \\\n     \nspan style=\nbackground-color: #FFCCFF;\nb\nRequirements = (TARGET.queue =?= \nanaly\n); \\\n/b\n/span\n\n] \n\n\n\n\nJob submitter\n\n\nTo filter jobs based on who submitted it, your routes will need a \nRequirements\n expression using the incoming job\u2019s \nOwner\n attribute. The following entry routes jobs to the HTCondor batch system iff the submitter is \nusatlas2\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nFiltering by job submitter\n; \\\n     \nspan style=\nbackground-color: #FFCCFF;\nb\nRequirements = (TARGET.Owner =?= \nusatlas2\n); \\\n/b\n/span\n\n] \n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can match based on regular expression. The following entry routes jobs to the PBS batch system iff the submitter\u2019s name begins with \nusatlas\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nFiltering by job submitter (regular expression)\n; \\\n     \nspan style=\nbackground-color: #FFCCFF;\nb\nRequirements = regexp(\n^usatlas\n, TARGET.Owner); \\\n/b\n/span\n\n] \n\n\n\n\nVOMS attribute\n\n\nTo filter jobs based on the subject of the job\u2019s proxy, your routes will need a \nRequirements\n expression using the incoming job\u2019s \nx509UserProxyFirstFQAN\n attribute. The following entry routes jobs to the PBS batch system if the proxy subject contains \n/cms/Role=Pilot\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nFiltering by VOMS attribute (regex)\n; \\\n     \nspan style=\nbackground-color: #FFCCFF;\nb\nRequirements = regexp(\n\\/cms\\/Role\\=pilot\n, TARGET.x509UserProxyFirstFQAN); \\\n/b\n/span\n\n] \n\n\n\n\nSetting a default\u2026\n\n\nThis section outlines how to set default job limits, memory, cores, queue, and maximum walltime.

For example, if the attribute \nfoo\n is set using \neval_set_foo\n in the \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n, you\u2018ll be unable to use \ndelete_foo\n to remote it from your jobs since the attribute is set using \neval_set_foo\n after the deletion occurs according to the order of operations. To get around this, we can take advantage of the fact that operations defined in \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n get overriden by the same operation in \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n. So to \u2019delete\u2019 \nfoo\n, we would add =eval_set_foo = \u201c\u201d= to the route in the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n, resulting in \nfoo\n being absent from the routed job.\n\n\nMore documentation can be found in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\nCopying attributes\n\n\nTo copy the value of an attribute of the incoming job to an attribute of the routed job, use \ncopy_\n.

Customizations are made in the form of job routes where each route corresponds to a separate job transformation: If an incoming job matches a job route\u2018s requirements, the route creates a transformed job (referred to as the \u2019routed job\u2019) that is then submitted to the batch system. The CE package comes with default routes located in  /etc/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-*.conf  that provide enough basic functionality for a small site.  If you have needs beyond delegating all incoming jobs to your batch system as they are, this document provides examples of common job routes and job route problems.  RoutePitfalls",

So when writing job routes, make sure that they are exclusive to each other and that your jobs can only match to a single route.  If a value is set in  JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS  with  eval_set_ variable , override it by using  eval_set_ variable  in the  JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES . Do this at your own risk as it may cause the CE to break.  Make sure to run  condor_ce_reconfig  after changing your routes, otherwise they will not take effect.  Before the last square bracket, make sure all lines end in a line continuation character (backslash). You can inspect the syntax of your routes with  condor_ce_config_val JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES  to see if HTCondor-CE has ingested them properly.  Do  not  set the  JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS  configuration variable yourself. This will cause the CE to stop functioning.  Do  not  set the job environment through the JobRouter. Instead, add any changes to the /etc/osg/config.d/  [Local Settings]  section and run osg-configure, as documented  here .

A stand-alone GridFTP server might be used under the following circumstances:\n\n\n\n\nA simple front-end to a filesystem allowing access over WAN - for example NFS.\n\n\nBeStMan is capable of distributing its workload among several gsiftp servers so if you expect large movements of data into/out of your site, multiple gsiftp servers can be set up.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014# Requirements\n\n\n\u2014## Host and OS\n\n\n\n\nOS must be \n.\n\n\nEPEL\n repos enabled.\n\n\nRoot access\n\n\n\n\n\u2014## Certificates\n\n\nCertificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertificate\n\n\nUser that owns certificate\n\n\nPath to certificate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost certificate\n\n\nroot\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n \\\nbr> \n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertificates\n\n\nInstructions\n to request a service certificate.\n\n\nYou will also need a copy of CA certificates (see below).\n\n\n\u2014## Users\n\n\nGridUsers\n For this package to function correctly, you will have to create the users needed for grid operation. Any user that can be authenticated should be created.\n\n\nFor grid-mapfile users, each line of the grid-mapfile is a certificate/user pair. Each user in this file should be created on the server.\n\n\nFor gums users, this means that each user that can be authenticated by gums should be created on the server.\n\n\nNote that these users must be kept in sync with the authentication method. For instance, if new users or rules are added in gums, then new users should also be added here. \nGridUsers\n\n\n\u2014## Networking\n\n\nFirewalls\n \nDocumentation/Release3.FirewallInformation\n \\ \nFirewalls\n\n\nIf you have a multi-homed host you may be interested in reading \nthis section\n.\n\n\n\u2014## Engineering Considerations\n\n\nIt is recommended that the GridFTP package be installed on its own server if:\n\n\n\n\nYou are serving the VOs that use storage heavily (CMS, ATLAS, CDF, and D0) and have more than 250 cores\n\n\nYour site will be managing more than 50 TB of disk space\n\n\n\n\nIf you are planning to have a Storage Element with BeStMan and have more than 1Gbps bandwidth, then you should plan on at least one GridFTP server per 4Gbps of available bandwidth (assuming you have 10Gbps interfaces on the server) if you want to maximize throughput.\n\n\nAlso, you have to decide what authorization mechanism you prefer. You may use either grid-mapfile or a GUMS server for users\u2019 authentication and authorization. We currently recommend using GUMS as it provides superior flexibility and allows a site to manage all of its mappings in one central location; most large sites use GUMS.\n\n\n OSG does not support launching the GridFTP server with xinetd \u2014 only launching with init is supported.\n\n\n\u2014# Install Instructions\n\n\nYumRepositories\n \nInstallCertAuth\n\n\nFull\n\n\nInstall\n GridFTP requires a certificate package to run. If you require a specific certificate package, follow the Documentation/Release3.InstallCertAuth instructions to install it. If you do not install a grid certificate package first, the install procedure will install one for you as part of its dependencies. (usually osg-ca-certs).\n\n\n\u2014## Installing the GridFTP Server\n\n\nFirst, you will need to install the GridFTP meta-package:\n\n\n[root@client ~]$ yum install osg-gridftp\n\n\n\n\nInstall\n\n\n\u2014# Configuration\n\n\n\u2014## Authorization\n\n\nAuthorization\n There are two authorization options:\n\n\n\n\nGridmap file\n\n\nGUMS authentication server\n\n\n\n\nPlease choose one of these and follow the instructions in one of the two following sections.\n\n\n\u2014### Configuring Gridmap Support\n\n\nGridmap\n By default, GridFTP uses a gridmap file, found in \n/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile\n. This file is not generated by default. There are two ways you can generate this file. You can generate this file manually, by including DN/username combinations. This is most useful for debugging. Otherwise, you can install edg-mkgridmap, which will periodically contact a list of VOMS servers that you specify. It assembles a list of users from those servers and creates a grid-mapfile. This grid-mapfile serves both as a list of authorized users and provides a mapping from user dns to local user ids.\n\n\nTo install edg_mkgridmap, perform the following steps\n\n\nyum install edg-mkgridmap\n\n\n\n\nReview \n/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf\n to make sure that it has all VOs that you are interested in and also to comment out any VOs that you do not wish to support.\n\n\nvi /etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf\n\n\n\n\nThis utility \nedg-mkgridmap\n runs as a cronjob \n/etc/cron.d/edg-mkgridmap-cron\n (by default every 6 hours). You can also run \nedg-mkgridmap\n manually to see that it generates \n/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile\n.\n\n\nedg-mkgridmap\n\n\n\n\nThen, you can enable/start the service.\n\n\n/sbin/service edg-mkgridmap start\n/sbin/chkconfig edg-mkgridmap on\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more on this page: \nedg_mkgridmap (on the CE)\n \nGridmap\n\n\n\u2014### Configuring GUMS support\n\n\nGums\n By default, GridFTP uses a gridmap file, found in \n/etc/grid-security/gridmap-file\n. If you want to use GUMS security (recommended), you will need to enable it using the following steps:\n\n\nFirst, edit \n/etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf\n and uncomment the globus callout.\n\n\nglobus_mapping liblcas_lcmaps_gt4_mapping.so lcmaps_callout\n\n\n\n\nNote that this used to be the full path to the library (\n/usr/lib64\n or \n/usr/lib\n), but now we rely on the linker for proper resolution in this file.\n\n\nNext edit \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n to edit your gums information:\n\n\n...\ngumsclient = \nlcmaps_gums_client.mod\n\n             \n-resourcetype ce\n\n             \n-actiontype execute-now\n\n             \n-capath /etc/grid-security/certificates\n\n             \n-cert   /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n\n             \n-key    /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n             \n--cert-owner root\n\n# Change this URL to your GUMS server\n             \n--endpoint https://\ngums.fnal.gov:8443\n/gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like to run SAZ, you will need to enable the relevant lines in the above file as well (more documentation to be added later). \nGums\n\n\nAuthorization\n\n\n\u2014## (Optional) Modifying the Environment\n\n\nEnvironment\n Environment variables are stored in \n/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server\n which is sourced on service startup. If you want to change LCMAPS log levels, or globus port ranges, you can edit them there.\n\n\n#Uncomment and modify for firewalls\n#export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=min,max\n#export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=min,max\n\n\n\n\nNote that the variables \nGLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE\n and \nGLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE\n can be set here to allow globus to navigate around firewall rules.\n\n\nTo troubleshoot LCMAPS authorization, you can add the following to \n/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server\n and choose a higher debug level:\n\n\n# level 0: no messages, 1: errors, 2: also warnings, 3: also notices,\n#  4: also info, 5: maximum debug\nLCMAPS_DEBUG_LEVEL=2\n\n\n\n\nOutput goes to \n/var/log/messages\n by default. Do not set logging to 5 on any production systems as that may cause systems to slow down significantly or become unresponsive.\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n\n#ConfigMultiHomed \u2014## Configuring a multi-homed server\n\n\nMultiHomed\n The GridFTP uses control connections, data connections and IPC connections. By default it listens in all interfaces but this can be changed by editing the configuration file \n/etc/gridftp.conf\n.\n\n\nTo use a single interface you can set \nhostname\n to the Hostname or IP address to use:\\\nhostname IP-TO-USE\\\n You can also set separately the \ncontrol_interface\n, \ndata_interface\n and \nipc_interface\n. E.g. on systems that have multiple network interfaces, you may want to associate data transfers with the fastest possible NIC available. This can be done in the GridFTP server by setting \ndata_interface\n: \\\n control\\_interface IP-TO-USE data\\_interface IP-TO-USE ipc\\_interface IP-TO-USE\\\n \nMultiHomed\n\n\nFor more options available for the GridFTP server, read the comments in the configuration file (\n/etc/gridftp.conf\n) or see the \nGlobus manual\n mentioned in the \nReference\n section below.\n\n\n\u2014# Starting GridFTP\n\n\nStarting\n\n\nStarting GridFTP:\n\n\n[root@client ~]$ service globus-gridftp-server start\n\n\n\n\nStarting\n To start Gridftp automatically at boot time\n\n\n[root@client ~]$ chkconfig globus-gridftp-server on\n\n\n\n\n\u2014# Stopping GridFTP \nStopping\n Stopping GridFTP:\n\n\n[root@client ~]$ service globus-gridftp-server stop\n\n\n\n\nStopping\n\n\n\u2014# Validation of services\n\n\nValidation\n\n\nThe GridFTP service can be validated by using globus-url-copy. You will need to run \ngrid-proxy-init\n or \nvoms-proxy-init\n in order to get a valid user proxy in order to communicate with the GridFTP server.\n\n\nUCL_PROMPT\n globus-url-copy file:///tmp/zero.source gsiftp://yourhost.yourdomain/tmp/zero\n\nUCL_PROMPT\n echo $?\n0\n\n\n\n\nNote that you should preferably not try to run validation as root, as globus-url-copy will sometimes attempt to use the host certificate instead of your user certificate, with confusing results. \nValidation\n\n\n\u2014# Gratia GridFTP Transfer Probe The \nGratia GridFTP probe\n collects the information about the Gridftp transfers and forwards it to central Gratia collector. You need to enable the probe first. To do this, make sure following is set in file /etc/gratia/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig\n\n\nEnableProbe=\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nAll other configuration settings should be suitable for most purposes. However, you can edit them if needed. The probe runs every 30 minutes as a cron job.\n\n\n\u2014# Useful Configuration and Log Files\n\n\nLocations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService/Process\n\n\nConfiguration

            "text": "\u2014# About this Document This page explains how to install the stand-alone Globus GridFTP server.  The GridFTP package contains components necessary to set up a stand-alone gsiftp server and tools used to monitor and report its performance. A stand-alone GridFTP server might be used under the following circumstances:   A simple front-end to a filesystem allowing access over WAN - for example NFS.  BeStMan is capable of distributing its workload among several gsiftp servers so if you expect large movements of data into/out of your site, multiple gsiftp servers can be set up.   \u2014# Requirements  \u2014## Host and OS   OS must be  .  EPEL  repos enabled.  Root access   \u2014## Certificates  Certificates     Certificate  User that owns certificate  Path to certificate      Host certificate  root  /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem  \\ br>  /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem     Certificates  Instructions  to request a service certificate.  You will also need a copy of CA certificates (see below).  \u2014## Users  GridUsers  For this package to function correctly, you will have to create the users needed for grid operation. Any user that can be authenticated should be created.  For grid-mapfile users, each line of the grid-mapfile is a certificate/user pair. Each user in this file should be created on the server.  For gums users, this means that each user that can be authenticated by gums should be created on the server.  Note that these users must be kept in sync with the authentication method. For instance, if new users or rules are added in gums, then new users should also be added here.  GridUsers  \u2014## Networking  Firewalls   Documentation/Release3.FirewallInformation  \\  Firewalls  If you have a multi-homed host you may be interested in reading  this section .  \u2014## Engineering Considerations  It is recommended that the GridFTP package be installed on its own server if:   You are serving the VOs that use storage heavily (CMS, ATLAS, CDF, and D0) and have more than 250 cores  Your site will be managing more than 50 TB of disk space   If you are planning to have a Storage Element with BeStMan and have more than 1Gbps bandwidth, then you should plan on at least one GridFTP server per 4Gbps of available bandwidth (assuming you have 10Gbps interfaces on the server) if you want to maximize throughput.  Also, you have to decide what authorization mechanism you prefer. You may use either grid-mapfile or a GUMS server for users\u2019 authentication and authorization. We currently recommend using GUMS as it provides superior flexibility and allows a site to manage all of its mappings in one central location; most large sites use GUMS.   OSG does not support launching the GridFTP server with xinetd \u2014 only launching with init is supported.  \u2014# Install Instructions  YumRepositories   InstallCertAuth  Full  Install  GridFTP requires a certificate package to run. If you require a specific certificate package, follow the Documentation/Release3.InstallCertAuth instructions to install it. If you do not install a grid certificate package first, the install procedure will install one for you as part of its dependencies. (usually osg-ca-certs).  \u2014## Installing the GridFTP Server  First, you will need to install the GridFTP meta-package:  [root@client ~]$ yum install osg-gridftp  Install  \u2014# Configuration  \u2014## Authorization  Authorization  There are two authorization options:   Gridmap file  GUMS authentication server   Please choose one of these and follow the instructions in one of the two following sections.  \u2014### Configuring Gridmap Support  Gridmap  By default, GridFTP uses a gridmap file, found in  /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile . This file is not generated by default. There are two ways you can generate this file. You can generate this file manually, by including DN/username combinations. This is most useful for debugging. Otherwise, you can install edg-mkgridmap, which will periodically contact a list of VOMS servers that you specify. It assembles a list of users from those servers and creates a grid-mapfile. This grid-mapfile serves both as a list of authorized users and provides a mapping from user dns to local user ids.  To install edg_mkgridmap, perform the following steps  yum install edg-mkgridmap  Review  /etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf  to make sure that it has all VOs that you are interested in and also to comment out any VOs that you do not wish to support.  vi /etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf  This utility  edg-mkgridmap  runs as a cronjob  /etc/cron.d/edg-mkgridmap-cron  (by default every 6 hours). You can also run  edg-mkgridmap  manually to see that it generates  /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile .  edg-mkgridmap  Then, you can enable/start the service.  /sbin/service edg-mkgridmap start\n/sbin/chkconfig edg-mkgridmap on  You can read more on this page:  edg_mkgridmap (on the CE)   Gridmap  \u2014### Configuring GUMS support  Gums  By default, GridFTP uses a gridmap file, found in  /etc/grid-security/gridmap-file . If you want to use GUMS security (recommended), you will need to enable it using the following steps:  First, edit  /etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf  and uncomment the globus callout.  globus_mapping liblcas_lcmaps_gt4_mapping.so lcmaps_callout  Note that this used to be the full path to the library ( /usr/lib64  or  /usr/lib ), but now we rely on the linker for proper resolution in this file.  Next edit  /etc/lcmaps.db  to edit your gums information:  ...\ngumsclient =  lcmaps_gums_client.mod \n              -resourcetype ce \n              -actiontype execute-now \n              -capath /etc/grid-security/certificates \n              -cert   /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem \n              -key    /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem \n              --cert-owner root \n# Change this URL to your GUMS server\n              --endpoint https:// gums.fnal.gov:8443 /gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort   If you would like to run SAZ, you will need to enable the relevant lines in the above file as well (more documentation to be added later).  Gums  Authorization  \u2014## (Optional) Modifying the Environment  Environment  Environment variables are stored in  /etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server  which is sourced on service startup. If you want to change LCMAPS log levels, or globus port ranges, you can edit them there.  #Uncomment and modify for firewalls\n#export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=min,max\n#export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=min,max  Note that the variables  GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE  and  GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE  can be set here to allow globus to navigate around firewall rules.  To troubleshoot LCMAPS authorization, you can add the following to  /etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server  and choose a higher debug level:  # level 0: no messages, 1: errors, 2: also warnings, 3: also notices,\n#  4: also info, 5: maximum debug\nLCMAPS_DEBUG_LEVEL=2  Output goes to  /var/log/messages  by default. Do not set logging to 5 on any production systems as that may cause systems to slow down significantly or become unresponsive.  Environment  #ConfigMultiHomed \u2014## Configuring a multi-homed server  MultiHomed  The GridFTP uses control connections, data connections and IPC connections. By default it listens in all interfaces but this can be changed by editing the configuration file  /etc/gridftp.conf .  To use a single interface you can set  hostname  to the Hostname or IP address to use:\\ hostname IP-TO-USE\\  You can also set separately the  control_interface ,  data_interface  and  ipc_interface . E.g. on systems that have multiple network interfaces, you may want to associate data transfers with the fastest possible NIC available. This can be done in the GridFTP server by setting  data_interface : \\  control\\_interface IP-TO-USE data\\_interface IP-TO-USE ipc\\_interface IP-TO-USE\\   MultiHomed  For more options available for the GridFTP server, read the comments in the configuration file ( /etc/gridftp.conf ) or see the  Globus manual  mentioned in the  Reference  section below.  \u2014# Starting GridFTP  Starting  Starting GridFTP:  [root@client ~]$ service globus-gridftp-server start  Starting  To start Gridftp automatically at boot time  [root@client ~]$ chkconfig globus-gridftp-server on  \u2014# Stopping GridFTP  Stopping  Stopping GridFTP:  [root@client ~]$ service globus-gridftp-server stop  Stopping  \u2014# Validation of services  Validation  The GridFTP service can be validated by using globus-url-copy. You will need to run  grid-proxy-init  or  voms-proxy-init  in order to get a valid user proxy in order to communicate with the GridFTP server.  UCL_PROMPT  globus-url-copy file:///tmp/zero.source gsiftp://yourhost.yourdomain/tmp/zero UCL_PROMPT  echo $?\n0  Note that you should preferably not try to run validation as root, as globus-url-copy will sometimes attempt to use the host certificate instead of your user certificate, with confusing results.  Validation  \u2014# Gratia GridFTP Transfer Probe The  Gratia GridFTP probe  collects the information about the Gridftp transfers and forwards it to central Gratia collector. You need to enable the probe first. To do this, make sure following is set in file /etc/gratia/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig  EnableProbe= 1   All other configuration settings should be suitable for most purposes. However, you can edit them if needed. The probe runs every 30 minutes as a cron job.  \u2014# Useful Configuration and Log Files  Locations     Service/Process  Configuration File  Description      GridFTP  /etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server  Environment variables for GridFTP and LCMAPS     /usr/share/osg/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server-plugin  Where environment variables for GridFTP plugin are included    Gratia Probe  /etc/gratia/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig  GridFTP Gratia Probe configuration    Gratia Probe  /etc/cron.d/gratia-probe-gridftp-transfer.cron  Cron tab file        Service/Process  Log File  Description      GridFTP  /var/log/gridftp.log  GridFTP transfer log     /var/log/gridftp-auth.log  GridFTP authorization log    Gratia probe  /var/logs/gratia      Locations  Full  \u2014# How to get Help?
